      <title>freq-words: learn to read with ClojureScript</title>
      <link>https://jstaffans.github.io/clojurescript/reagent/boot/2015/05/21/freq-words.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My father, a retired elementary school teacher, runs a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kjellstaffans.fi&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; 
offering material for young children who are just starting to learn how to read and 
write in Swedish. A big portion of the material is geared towards children who experience 
difficulties learning the basics of reading and writing and one of the teaching aids
is an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kjellstaffans.fi/wp-content/uploads/frekord.html&quot;&gt;old Flash application&lt;/a&gt;
I wrote almost a decade ago; children can use the application to practice reading some of 
the most common words in the Swedish language. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spicing up Java projects with Clojure</title>
      <link>https://jstaffans.github.io/clojure/java/2015/05/21/clojure-spice.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many engineers with an interest in Clojure are probably working on Java code bases for most of the day. 
This doesn&amp;#39;t have to be the end of the world if you&amp;#39;re tickling to write some Clojure code, as there are many ways of 
bringing Clojure to existing Java-based projects. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A vertical microservice with Spring Boot</title>
      <link>https://jstaffans.github.io/blog/2015/03/16/spring-boot.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.komoot.de&quot;&gt;komoot&lt;/a&gt;, we have lately been busy moving to a more microservice-oriented architecture. Many of our new features, such as the card feed
that shows up whenever our mobile apps are opened, have been implemented in this fashion. We have also refactored and re-implemented some existing core components as 
dedicated services, one example being our routing engine.  &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Taking duct for a spin</title>
      <link>https://jstaffans.github.io/blog/2015/02/08/duct.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been meaning to try building a simple web application using Stuart Sierra&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stuartsierra/component&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/a&gt; library for a while now. If you haven&amp;#39;t heard about it, it&amp;#39;s definitely worth having a look at - it is a lovely way of organising the different components that go into an application and gives you a smooth workflow in the REPL.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A new blog is born</title>
      <link>https://jstaffans.github.io/blog/2015/01/11/a-new-blog-is-born.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is time for a new blog. My experiences over the last few years have changed the way I develop software a lot and I feel the need to reflect on that. 
I am also now more focused on the technological side of software development as opposed to working as an agile coach and scrum master, which was what
a large part of the posts on my previous blog were about. &lt;/p&gt;
