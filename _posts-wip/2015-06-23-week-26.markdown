I spend a significant amount of time reading mailing lists, news outlets and chatrooms, mostly
related to programming and Clojure in particular. If it's been a particularily interesting
week, I will gather my thoughts as a blog entry here for later reference. 

#### Category Theory

Maybe Haskell
Relevance to programming
Cats library
Links

#### 1+N problem

"Of course someone else has had my problem!"
Muse

#### Queues, back pressure

Forms of back pressure - thread blocking, HTTP codes

#### How hard proper API design and HATEOAS is

JSON is not a hypermedia format - no links - a JSON api is not RESTful
Extensions like HAL, Collection+JSON, Transit
XML is not so bad after all?
